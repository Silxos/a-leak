Hi, it’s me again sadly still here but anyways today so far is going good is just that school is hard seriously algebra is kinda hard but i have a good grade because i really don’t want to take it again in the high school so yeah and also i planning to tell vic about something but i’m also thinking i shouldn’t tell them but idk.Hopefully people just leave me alone because it seems they don’t so today i’m not gonna talk that much like last year in 7th grade i was the “quiet kid” but yeah people really didn’t bother me that much until i said i preferred to be use by they/ them but they thought it was funny to still use she/her but its ok they didn’t know but i soon realized that they said she in a funny tone and then it click me they are making fun of me:D funny right and as always have to go bye>:3

Hi,it’s me again sadly still here.Today so far is going not so good why because just now i saw vic walking with landen when i told him not to talk to her because he is a creep and he still did ,anyways hopefully they tell me the truth at some point saying i don’t like you because i think they don’t like me because of how i act or how i walk or anything about is wrong but that's ok right?.My “mom” did tell me that I'm just crazy.I think I might be wrong. Who knows until the truth comes out. I don't have to worry about anything besides grades and mental health^-^,Will have to go bye:).

I don't wanna seem the way I do
But I'm confident when I'm with you
Lately all I feel is bad and bruised
Tired of tripping on my shoes
But when he loves me I feel like I'm floating
When he calls me pretty I feel like somebody
Even when we fade eventually to nothing
You will always be my favorite form of loving
When I start to tumble from the sky
You remind me how to fly
Lately, I've been feeling not alive
But you bring me back to life
But when she loves me, I feel like I'm floating
When she calls me pretty, I feel like somebody
Even when we fade eventually, to nothing
You will always be my favorite form of loving
But when they love me, I feel like I'm floating
 
When they call me pretty, I feel like somebody
 
Even when we fade eventually, I'm nothing
You will always be my favorite form of loving

                                                 Line without a hook Ricky Montgomery

I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me
When we're alone
You can hold my hand
If no one's home
Do you like it when I'm away?
If I went and hurt my body, baby
Would you love me the same?
I can feel all my bones coming back
And I'm craving motion
Mama never really learns how to live by herself
It's a curse
And it's growing
You're a pond and I'm an ocean
Oh, all my emotions
Feel like explosions when you are around
And I've found a way to kill the sounds, oh
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?
Oh, and if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
I said no (I said no), I said no (I said no)
Listen close, it's a no
The wind is a-pounding on my back
And I found hope in a heart attack
Oh at last, it is past
Now I've got it, and you can't have it
Baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden, oh
And if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
Darling, when I'm fast asleep
I've seen this person watching me
Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?" Oh
Guess there is something, and there is nothing
There is nothing in between
And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer
Watching over me, he's singing
"She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy"
He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a hook"
Baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden, oh
And if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
 
 
                                                                    February 12, 2022

Venus, planet of love
Was destroyed by global warming
Did its people want too much, too?
Did its people want too much?
And I don't want your pity
I just want somebody near me
Guess I'm a coward
I just want to feel alright
And I know no one will save me
I just need someone to kiss
Give me one good honest kiss
And I'll be alright
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody, nobody
I've been big and small
And big and small
And big and small again
And still nobody wants me
Still nobody wants me
And I know no one will save me
I'm just asking for a kiss
Give me one good movie kiss
And I'll be alright
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody (nobody)

Nobody, nobody

Toss your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart
Baby, bang it up inside
I'm not wearing my usual lipstick
I thought maybe we would kiss tonight
Baby will you kiss me already and
Toss your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart?
Baby, bang it up inside
Baby, though I've closed my eyes
I know who you pretend I am
I know who you pretend I am
Do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?
Do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?
Do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?


























                                                 Boy in the bubble by Alec benjamin 



It was 6:48, I was walking home
Stepped through the gate, and I'm all alone
I had chicken on the plate, but the food was cold
Then I covered up my face so that no one knows
I didn't want trouble
I'm the boy in the bubble
But then came trouble
When my mom walked into the living room
She said, "Boy, you gotta tell me what they did to you"
I said, "You don't wanna know the things I had to do"
She said, "Son, you gotta tell me why you're black and blue"
I said I didn't want trouble
I'm the boy in the bubble
But then came trouble
And my heart was pumping
Chest was screaming
Mind was running
Air was freezing
Put my hands up
Put my hands up
I told this kid I'm ready for a fight
Punch my face
Do it 'cause I like the pain
Every time you curse my name
I know you want the satisfaction
It's not gonna happen
Knock me out
Kick me when I'm on the ground
It's only gonna let you down
Come the lightning and the thunder
You're the one who'll suffer, suffer
Well I squared him up, left my chest exposed
He threw a quick left hook and it broke my nose
I had thick red blood running down my clothes
And a sick, sick look 'cause I like it though
I said I didn't want trouble
I'm the boy in the bubble
But then came trouble
And my heart was pumping
Chest was screaming
Mind was running
Nose was bleeding
Put my hands up
Put my hands up
I told this kid I'm ready for a fight
Punch my face
Do it 'cause I like the pain
Every time you curse my name
I know you want the satisfaction
It's not gonna happen
Knock me out
Kick me when I'm on the ground
It's only gonna let you down
Come the lightning and the thunder
You're the one who'll suffer
It was 6:48, he was walking home
With the blood on his hand from my broken nose
But like every other day, he was scared to go
Back to his house 'cause his pops was home
Drowning his troubles in whiskey bubbles
Just looking for trouble
Well, there's no excuse for the things he did
But there's a lot at home that he's dealing with
Because his dad's been drunk since he was a kid
And I hope one day that he'll say to him
Put down those bubbles and that belt buckle
In this broken bubble
Punch my face
Do it 'cause I like the pain
Every time you curse my name
I know you want the satisfaction
It's not gonna happen
Knock me out
Kick me when I'm on the ground
It's only gonna let you down
Come the lightning and the thunder
You're the one who'll suffer, suffer

Hi,it's me again, sadly still here.Anyways I have some bad news and some good news, Good news is that I’m gonna attempted to kiss my gf but i don’t think i should because idk how to kiss someone and bad news is that I don’t think i want to celebrate my birthday because will my dad girlfriend is gonna be there and i don’t want to see her and i think my dad is planning to marry her which is not good because i just don’t like her but she is kinda nicer than perla aka my stepmom, i mean she was mean she kinda hated me but i don’t think so right i mean she sometimes yell at me but that was because i messed up its normal and that one time when she saw my grades and they were good and she didn’t say anything besides “work harder stupid” and yeah but she did come to every event and one fieldtrip she came but that was when she didn’t have a job but now she does so its kinda hard to spend time with her now but this one time i really regretted not doing it with her because i just now realised that she did because my dad was gonna get a divorce and that day was mother and daughter bond day i think and we went to the selon and i didn’t want to go because people scare me sometimes and when she got mad at me for not  doing it with i said “but mom you needed it and you work so hard and yet this is what get being yelled at for no reason beside there were only two seats you and joselyn” and yet she got me in trouble but thats why i regretted it so much i should have been there but i didn’t but the day that turned my life around was when she told me that “guys i have some news to tell you about your dad ,Your dad has been cheating on me for almost 5 years now and so i won’t talk to you guys anymore” and that was in 2021 7th grade which that year was great because of my grades but now i have no mom again and if my dad does not get a better job i might have to back to that place again which i do not want to go my dad girlfriend or worse i think you know and as always have to go bye.

 I steal a few breaths
From the world for a minute
And then I'll be nothing forever
And all of my memories
And all of the things I have seen
Will be gone
With my eyes with my body with me
But me and my husband
We're doing better
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're sticking together
And I am the idiot with the painted face
In the corner, taking up space
But when he walks in, I am loved, I am loved
Me and my husband
We're doing better
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're doing better

  Shut up, count your calories
I never looked good in mom jeans
Wish I was like you
Blue-eyed blondie, perfect body
Maybe I should try harder?
You should lower your expectations
I'm no quick-curl barbie
I was never cut out for prom queen
If I get more pretty
Do you think he will like me?
Dissect my insecurities
I'm a defect, surgical project
It's getting hard to breathe
There's plastic wrap in my cheeks
Maybe I should try harder
You should lower your beauty standards
I'm no quick-curl barbie
I was never cut out for prom queen
If I'm pretty, will you like me?
They say, "Beauty makes boys happy"
I've been starving myself
Carving skin until my bones are showing
Teach me how to be okay
I don't wanna downplay my emotions
They say, "Beauty is vain”
You'll only be happy if you look a certain way🎜~ 
I wanna be okay
I wanna be okay                                                
                                                                      Abril 6, 2022(shitty day)  
Hi,it’s me again,sadly still here.Anyways today is fucking horrible, so basically we can’t have transition anymore because some students still won’t listen and now we only have 2 minutes to use the restroom like what the fuck i takes like 5 or 4 minutes like is not that serious like as soon we enter the class those 5 minutes we do NOTHING and yet we still can’t use the fucking restroom now I’m freaking mad at some of the teachers that accepted  this nEw RuLe is fucking stupid like is not fair that some of the students punish just because someone like for example a person robs a bank and that person did it and yet they just pick a random person and blame them just because they did nothing wrong and that person that robbed the bank has ZERO consequences.Like that sounds stupid right so thats why i think is fucking stupid that this bitches won’t fucking listen like what the hell and now we have these rule that don’t make sense bad thing is that is a charter school whichs means we have to follow the rules so we can’t protest about this shit like thats fucking stupid you know and now there is nothing we can do about this but i have a plan I’m gonna have a “meeting” with the teachers that accepted these rules because once again it’s fucking stupid and WE ONLY HAVE 8 WEEKS LEFT OF SHITTY SCHOOL LIKE WTF anyways have to go bye hopefully see you tomorrow bye ig.

I don't feel a single thing
Have the pills done too much
Haven't caught up with my friends in weeks
And now we're outta touch
I've been driving in L.A.
And the world it feels too big
Like a floating ball that's bound to break
Snap my psyche like a twig
And I just wanna see if you feel the same as me
Do you ever get a little bit tired of life
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hanging by a thread but you gotta survive
'Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air
Am I past repair
A little bit tired of tryin' to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinkin'
There's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin'
Tryna stay afloat
So I got these quick repairs to cope
Guess I'm just broken and broke
The prescriptions on its way
With a name I can't pronounce
And the dose I gotta take
Boy, I wish that I could count
'Cause I just wanna see if this could make me happy
Do you ever get a little bit tired of life
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hanging by a thread but you gotta survive
'Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air
Am I past repair
A little bit tired of tryin' to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinking
There's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin'
Tryna stay afloat
So I got these quick repairs to cope
Do you ever get a little bit tired of life
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like a numb little bug that's gotta survive
That's gotta survive

I kind of wanna throw my phone across the room
'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true
With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies, wish I didn't care
I know their beauty is not my lack, but it feels like that
Weight is on my back, and I can't let it go
Com-comparison is killing me slowly
I think I think too much 'bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself, rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else, but jealousy, jealousy started following me
Started following me
Blue eyes, see everyone getting all the things I want
I'm happy for them, but then again I'm not
Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos
I can't stand it, oh, God, I sound crazy
Their win is not my loss
I know it's true, but I can't help getting caught up in the
Co-com-comparison is killing me slowly
I think I think too much 'bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself, rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else, but jealousy, jealousy
All your friends are so cool, you go out every night
In your daddy's nice car, yeah, you're living the life
Got a pretty face, pretty boyfriend too
I wanna be you so bad and I don't even know you
All I see is what I should be
Happier, prettier, jealousy, jealousy
All I see, what I should be
I'm losing it, all I get is jealousy, jealousy
Com-comparison is killing me slowly
I think I think too much 'bout kids who don't know me
And I'm so sick of myself, rather be, rather be (oh, oh)
Anyone, anyone else, jealousy, jealousy
Oh, I'm so sick of myself, I'd rather be, rather be (oh, oh)
Anyone, anyone else, jealousy, jealousy
Started following me

Hi, it’s me again ,sadly still here. So today is going good so far. My little sisters said, “Hey Rachel, do you want to paint your nails for 1 dollar?'' and I said “ sure but only a penny ok?”, and then they painted all my fingers black my favorite color but here's the thing school jerks and emo memes and so when i came to school i was trying to take off the nail polish right and then out of nowhere viktoria was there and i was “i've fucked up” and then they saw i grab my hand and i was like “crap now they know” and like yeah that happened. I’m not sure if i should forgive landen you know is just that everything he did was so stupid and it all started when i said “i like viktoria” and he said “I also like viktoria” and it went downhill since then and I’m still mad at him like is about to 15 and yet he still acts the way he does but for now I’m just not gonna talk to him because of that and i even texted him about it to and i forgot what he said but still i won’t be friends with him unless he says “sorry for the things the I did and said “ but if he says something out of line I’m done with him I just can’t deal with him anymore anyways as always have to go bye:/.

                                                            
                                                           


                        Brutal by Olivia Rodrigo 
       

 I want it to be, like, messy
I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I, if not exploited?
And I'm so sick of 17
Where's my fucking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
"Enjoy your youth, " I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more
All I did was try my best
This the kind of thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (ah, ah, ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here
(Yeah!)
I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way I'm perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park
All I did was try my best
This the kind of thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (ah, ah, ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here
(Yeah! Just having a really good time)
Got a broken ego, broken heart
(It's brutal out here, it's brutal out here)
And God, I don't even know where to start

Hi, it’s me again, sadly still here, Anyways today so far is ok I guess but i really just wanted to let this out, so when i was in 3rd grade I had this one friend that I loved very much and lets just say she was bi she told me before something happened and she told me that she liked me and i said sorry i don’t like you i just think of you as a friend and she said oh ok i understand and then yeah move forward a couple weeks later its abril 6 because my birthday was on 4th my friend told me happy birthday and i said thanks and then school ended and she told “ bye see you soon” , that was the last words I heard from her and move forward I heard the teachers saying “I can’t believe she is dead she was just a sweet girl”, i thought “who?” and then they said “(her name) her life must have been horrible especially her dad who was alcoholic and the mother did nothing that is sad”, after i heard that i started crying my best friend is dead and then after school i went to my bed i cried and my father wasn't there of course and i just went to bed and went back to school the next day and the teachers saw me crying yesterday and said “rachel we’re sorry for what you heard the other day but it’ll be alright ok?”, I said “ no, she was my best friend and now i don’t know who to talk to anymore i should've been there for her” and ever since that day, now i asked my friend if they are ok multiple times and now i don’t know what to do anymore anyways that is really all i just wanted to say anyways as always have to go bye:\
